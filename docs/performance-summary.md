## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Message Validation Failures (99.96% failure rate)
```
Symptoms:
- Sequence number mismatches (expected vs actual)
- Checksum validation failures
- Zero-length messages being processed
- Consumer logic not properly initializing sequence tracking

Impact: 1000x+ performance degradation in realistic scenarios
```

### 2. Platform Limitations (macOS/Apple Silicon)
```
What we CAN'T do on macOS:
- Kernel bypass (DPDK, io_uring, AF_XDP)
- NUMA tuning (single-socket design)
- Full thread pinning and real-time scheduling
- Hugepages for memory optimization

What we CAN do:
- SIMD optimization (NEON for ARM64)
- Memory locking (mlock)
- Limited thread pinning
- Cache-line alignment
```

### 3. Architecture Bottlenecks
```
Memory Access:
- Cache misses in hot paths
- False sharing between producers/consumers
- Suboptimal memory layout
- Allocation overhead in critical sections

Synchronization:
- Atomic operations in hot paths
- Memory barriers on every operation
- Lock contention in multi-producer scenarios
- Context switching overhead
```
